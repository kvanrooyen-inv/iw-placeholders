# How to use this?

You will need to use the `raw.githubusercontent.com` link, the trouble is that GitHub doesn't always show you the option to get to this link (e.g. PDFs don't have the option.) Luckily for us, they use a predictable format that you can modify as needed.

## Raw GitHub Link Formatting

This is the formatting used for all raw links:

```
raw.githubusercontent.com/{username}/{repo}/refs/heads/{branch}/{filename}
```

- `username`: Your GitHub username.
- `repo`: This is the name of the repository where the files are located
- `branch`: In most cases, this will probably be main/master
- `filename`: This is the filename of the file you want. Remember to include the file extension (e.g. .pdf or .toml)

If we were to replace those variables with real word data we would get something that looks like this:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kvanrooyen-inv/iw-placeholders/refs/heads/main/Lorem-Ipsum.pdf
```
